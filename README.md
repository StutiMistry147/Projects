## Quantitative & Big Data Projects
- <ins>Trading Backtester</ins>: A Python-based engine designed to simulate and validate trading strategies against historical market data.
- <ins>Stochastic Congestion Model</ins>: A probabilistic simulation project analyzing system bottlenecks and flow using mathematical modeling.
- <ins>Log Parser</ins>: A utility built to handle and process large-scale system logs, demonstrating early Big Data processing capabilities.

## Systems Engineering & Reliability
- <ins>Formal Verification (Promela)</ins>: I use the Spin Model Checker to prove the correctness of concurrent systems.
- <ins>Stopwatch Model</ins>: Verified for state safety and deadlock freedom.
- <ins>Concurrency checker</ins>: A C/C++ project focused on identifying synchronization issues in multi-threaded environments.
- <ins>Traffic Monitor</ins>: A real-time system simulation focused on event-driven logic and state management.
